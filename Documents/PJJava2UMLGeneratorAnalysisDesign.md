Java-to-UML Diagram Generator

Author Jags-Programming []

# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 Purpose

The Java-to-UML Diagram Generator is a tool designed to analyze Java source code and generate UML diagrams, including class diagrams and sequence diagrams. The tool will parse Java code, extract relevant information, and visualize relationships between classes, methods, and interactions.

## 1.2 Scope

Parse Java source code to extract class structures, methods, relationships, and dependencies.

Generate UML diagrams in standard formats such as PNG, SVG, and PlantUML.

Provide both in-memory processing for small projects and persistent storage for large-scale analysis.

Support integration with CI/CD pipelines for automated UML generation.

Allow configurable hybrid storage modes to optimize performance and scalability.

Provide an interactive UI and CLI for ease of use.

Support cloud storage and integration with online UML tools.

## 1.3 Users & Stakeholders

Software Developers: Understand and document system architecture.

Architects: Analyze and refine system design.

QA Teams: Validate system behavior through sequence diagrams.

Project Managers: Gain insights into project structure and dependencies.

# 2. Functional Requirements

## 2.1 Use Cases & Functionalities

| Use Case | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Parse Java Code | Read and analyze Java source files to extract classes, methods, and relationships. |
| Generate Class Diagrams | Convert parsed data into UML class diagrams. |
| Generate Sequence Diagrams | Identify method calls and interactions to create sequence diagrams. |
| Support Multiple Outputs | Export diagrams as PNG, SVG, and PlantUML code. |
| Incremental Updates | Track changes in code and update UML diagrams accordingly. |
| Persistence & Storage | Store parsed data in memory or a database for large projects. |
| Integration with CI/CD | Generate UML diagrams automatically in a CI/CD pipeline. |
| Hybrid Storage Configuration | Allow users to switch between in-memory and persistent storage dynamically. |
| Interactive UI | Provide a graphical user interface for easy diagram visualization. |
| Cloud Integration | Store and retrieve UML diagrams from cloud-based services. |
| Code Annotation Support | Recognize annotations and include them in UML diagrams. |

# 3. Design Decisions

## 3.1 Java Parsing Library Study

Three primary Java parsing libraries were analyzed:

| Library | Pros | Cons |
| --- | --- | --- |
| JavaParser | Easy to use, actively maintained, lightweight | Limited support for complex AST manipulations |
| Eclipse JDT | Powerful, supports full AST manipulation | Requires Eclipse dependencies, more complex |
| Spoon | Rich transformation capabilities, works well for refactoring | Heavier learning curve |

ðŸ‘‰ Decision: JavaParser is chosen for its simplicity and efficiency. Eclipse JDT may be considered for future enhancements.

# 4. System Architecture & Storage Strategy

## 4.1 Hybrid Storage Strategy

A hybrid approach will be used:

Small & Medium Projects â†’ Process everything in-memory for speed and simplicity.

Large Projects â†’ Store parsed data persistently to avoid repeated parsing overhead.

Cloud Storage â†’ Optionally store UML diagrams in cloud repositories.

Configurable Storage Mode â†’ Users can specify their preference in a configuration file or CLI flag.

## 4.2 Storage Implementation & Configuration

| Option | Pros | Cons | Best Use Case |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| In-Memory | Fast, no setup required | Cannot persist data across sessions | Small projects & quick analysis |
| JSON/XML Files | Human-readable, easy to export/import | Slower querying | Small projects requiring persistence |
| SQLite/PostgreSQL | Good for structured data, supports indexing and querying | More complex setup | Medium to large projects needing fast lookups |
| NoSQL (MongoDB, Redis) | Fast lookups, flexible schema | Not ideal for complex queries | High-speed access required |
| Cloud Storage (AWS S3, Google Drive) | Remote access, backup | Requires API setup, latency concerns | Distributed teams & backup needs |

ðŸ‘‰ Implementation:

Default to in-memory processing.

Store parsed data in JSON for small projects.

Use SQLite/PostgreSQL for large projects requiring persistence.

Allow users to specify their preferred storage method via a configuration file:

{

"storage_mode": "memory",  // Options: "memory", "json", "database", "cloud"

"database": {

"type": "sqlite",

"connection_string": "uml_data.db"

},

"cloud": {

"provider": "AWS S3",

"bucket_name": "uml-diagrams"

}

}

## 4.3 Dynamic Storage Handling

To support hybrid storage, a StorageService will be implemented using the Strategy Pattern:

interface StorageStrategy {

void saveParsedData(ParsedData data);

ParsedData loadParsedData();

}

class InMemoryStorage implements StorageStrategy {

private Map<String, ParsedData> cache = new HashMap<>();

public void saveParsedData(ParsedData data) { cache.put(data.getId(), data); }

public ParsedData loadParsedData() { return cache.get(data.getId()); }

}

class CloudStorage implements StorageStrategy {

public void saveParsedData(ParsedData data) { /* Upload to cloud */ }

public ParsedData loadParsedData() { /* Retrieve from cloud */ }

}

The system will dynamically select a storage strategy based on user configuration.

## 6.1 Dependency Tree for the UML Diagram Generator

Below is the dependency order from least dependent (independent classes) to most dependent (highly integrated classes).

### Least Dependent (Foundation Classes) â€“ No dependencies

These classes define core data structures and don't rely on other components.

ConfigurationManager â†’ Loads and manages system settings.

FieldEntity â†’ Represents a class field.

MethodEntity â†’ Represents a method.

CodeEntity â†’ Represents a Java class or interface.

### Low Dependency â€“ Depends on Foundation Classes

These classes interact with basic data structures.

RelationshipManager â†’ Manages dependencies between CodeEntity objects.

FileHandler â†’ Reads/writes Java files (but doesnâ€™t interact with diagrams).

### Medium Dependency â€“ Uses Data & Parsing

These classes rely on file handling, parsing, and configuration.

JavaParserService â†’ Parses Java source code, uses FileHandler, CodeEntity, MethodEntity, and FieldEntity.

StorageService â†’ Stores UML diagrams, depends on ConfigurationManager.

### High Dependency â€“ Uses Parsed Data & Generates Output

These classes depend on parsed Java data and configuration settings.

ClassDiagramService â†’ Uses JavaParserService and RelationshipManager.

SequenceDiagramService â†’ Uses JavaParserService and method relationships.

### Most Dependent (Final Application Components) â€“ Uses All Services

These classes integrate everything and provide the final tool functionality.

UMLDiagramGenerator â†’ Uses ClassDiagramService, SequenceDiagramService, and StorageService.

CLIApplication â†’ Uses UMLDiagramGenerator and ConfigurationManager for command-line execution.

GraphicalUI â†’ Uses UMLDiagramGenerator, StorageService, and ConfigurationManager to provide a user interface.

## Execution Order Based on Dependencies

To build this project in phases, follow this order:

Start with ConfigurationManager, FieldEntity, MethodEntity, CodeEntity (core data structures).

Build RelationshipManager and FileHandler (manages dependencies and file I/O).

Develop JavaParserService and StorageService (parsing and storing data).

Implement ClassDiagramService and SequenceDiagramService (generate UML).

Finalize UMLDiagramGenerator, CLIApplication, and GraphicalUI (main application logic).
