## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

âœ… **Performance**
- Must process large Java projects (1000+ classes) within reasonable time constraints.
- Use parallel processing where applicable.

âœ… **Scalability**
- Should support small, medium, and enterprise-level projects.
- Web-based version should handle multiple concurrent users.

âœ… **Extensibility**
- Allow future support for additional languages (Kotlin, Scala, etc.).
- Support plug-ins for additional diagram types.

âœ… **Usability**
- GUI/Web interface should be intuitive with drag-and-drop support.
- CLI must provide clear documentation and examples.

âœ… **Platform Independence**
- Must run on Windows, Mac, and Linux.
- Should support containerized deployment (Docker, Kubernetes).

âœ… **Security**
- Prevent execution of malicious Java code.
- Implement sandboxing mechanisms for uploaded projects.

## 5. Constraints & Assumptions

ðŸ”¹ **Constraints**
- Requires Java 17+ for execution.
- Limited to static code analysis (dynamic method calls in Sequence Diagrams may not be detected).
- No runtime monitoring â€“ tool works on source code, not compiled binaries.

ðŸ”¹ **Assumptions**
- Users will provide valid Java source code.
- Users will specify which diagrams they need.

## 6. Architectural Considerations

### 6.1 System Architecture
- Modular architecture with separate components for parsing, analysis, and output generation.
- Microservices-based approach for web deployment.

### 6.2 Technology Stack
- **Backend:** Java 21, Spring Boot
- **Parsing Engine:** JavaParser, Eclipse JDT, or Spoon
- **Diagram Generation:** PlantUML, Graphviz, or custom rendering engine
- **CLI:** Apache Commons CLI
- **GUI:** JavaFX or Electron-based Web UI
- **Web API:** RESTful API with Spring Boot

## 7. Potential Challenges

| Challenge                                | Mitigation Strategy |
|------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| Large projects take too long to process. | Implement multi-threading, caching, and lazy loading. |
| Complex Java features (e.g., generics, reflection) are hard to parse. | Use a robust parsing engine like JavaParser. |
| Sequence Diagrams require dynamic analysis. | Use instrumentation-based approach for dynamic call tracking. |
| Users require customization of UML output. | Provide a configuration file to control diagram generation. |

## 8. Future Enhancements
- Support for additional languages (Kotlin, Scala, Python).
- Cloud-based version for remote usage.
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins).
- Live UML rendering for real-time code visualization.
