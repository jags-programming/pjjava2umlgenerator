/**
 * Represents a relationship between two code entities in a UML diagram.
 * 
 * This class models various types of relationships, such as inheritance,
 * implementation, association, and method calls, between source and target
 * entities. It provides methods to convert these relationships into PlantUML
 * syntax for diagram generation.
 * 
 * Responsibilities:
 * - Encapsulates the details of a relationship, including its type, source, and target.
 * - Supports relationships involving methods (e.g., caller-callee).
 * - Converts relationships into PlantUML syntax for diagram generation.
 * 
 * Usage Example:
 * {@code
 * CodeEntity source = new CodeEntity("com.example.ClassA");
 * CodeEntity target = new CodeEntity("com.example.ClassB");
 * Relative relationship = new Relative(Relative.RelationshipType.INHERITANCE, target);
 * String plantUmlSyntax = relationship.toPlantUmlSyntax(source.getName());
 * System.out.println(plantUmlSyntax);
 * }
 * 
 * Dependencies:
 * - {@link CodeEntity}
 * 
 * Thread Safety:
 * - This class is not thread-safe as it maintains mutable state.
 * 
 * Limitations:
 * - Assumes that the source and target entities are valid and have fully qualified names.
