/**
 * Represents a field within a Java class.
 * 
 * This class encapsulates the details of a field, including its name, type, and visibility.
 * It provides functionality for comparing fields, checking equality, and generating hash codes
 * for use in collections.
 * 
 * Responsibilities:
 * - Encapsulates the details of a field, such as name, type, and visibility.
 * - Supports comparison of fields for sorting.
 * - Provides equality and hash code implementations for use in collections.
 * 
 * Usage Example:
 * {@code
 * FieldEntity field = new FieldEntity("id", "int");
 * field.setVisibility("private");
 * System.out.println("Field: " + field.getName() + ", Type: " + field.getType());
 * }
 * 
 * Limitations:
 * - Assumes that the field name and type are non-null.
 * - Does not support advanced field features such as annotations or generics.
 * 
 * Thread Safety:
 * - This class is not thread-safe as it maintains mutable state.
